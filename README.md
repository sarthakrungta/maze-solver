# Maze-Solver
C++  algorithm for Path Planning, and using it with a simple simulated 2D robot moving around a 2D Environment. 

## Description
This project was developed individually as a task in my Advanced Programmming Techniques class suring my course @ RMIT University.  
The code calculates a path in a given 2D environment, which includes a start point, end point and hurdles.  

## Example
For a given path like the following, 
========
===F====
===.====
===...==
====.===
====S===

The code would return a solved path, like follows:
========
===F====
===^====
===^<.==
====^===
====S===


## Instructions to run
1) Compile the 4 C++ files together into one executable file
2) Run executable file
